# PhotoBooth rental system

[&#x1F534;] INFORMATION FOR THE FINAL DEADLINE:

Please check "API" branch to see implemented API project. We do not want to use API in our final DotVVM app, so API isn't inculded in our master branch.

The application is available at https://muniphotobooth.azurewebsites.net/ . Due to it being deployed to lowest tier appservice the app can take several MINUTES to start when cold.

## Repository of school project for subject PV179

The finished project should be web based application where user can fill out the form to reserve the photobooth for his event. User will have access to edit his reservation, register and log in to manage several reservations and administrator will have overview of all reservation with option to accept/edit/remove them.
